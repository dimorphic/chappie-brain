#### Preview

This was used as reference for my 'insane' test case presentation @ [Angular-vs-React](http://bit.ly/angular-vs-react).
This test is focused on a specific case, update items, and it's scores should be taken as is, and not as an overall score of one framework vs another.

### Getting started

1. Clone the repo of desired flavor (brain-react, brain-angular or brain-canvas):
  
  `$ git clone -b brain-FLAVOR https://github.com/dimorphic/chappie-brain`

2. Get in there

  `$ cd chappie-brain`
  
3. Install dev & app depedencies:

  `$ npm install && bower install`
  
4. Start it up:

  `$ npm start`

### Todo:

- [ ] test more libs/frameworks?
- [ ] TBA

### Contribution:

I've tried to keep things simple and make'em as fast as possible with each method/framework used.
I'm looking forward to contributions with 'speed hacks' if any or even other 'flavor' branches and tests. Go nuts, go hacking! :)
